# Pysde_sentaurus

This package is a wrapper that generates a .sde file used by Sentaurus TCAD structure editor to generate a physical structure and mesh it.

Sde files are written in scheme, which I personally find fairly cumbersome, epecially if you want to do simple math (postfix notation is complicated for my simple mind). Instead, I wrote this wrapper so that sde files can be generated with python, which I find much more readable and understandable.

To find an example of how to use pysde_sentaurus, you can check the example in the `/examples` folder. This is a very crude implementation but I hope to improve it as I kerep using it for my work.

Any help/request is welcome.
